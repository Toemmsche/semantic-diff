# Semantic Diff / Query Plan Visualizer

This repository contains:
- A semantic diff algorithm for XML documents (`npm run main`)
- A visualization tool for differences between normalized query plans, which makes use of the semantic diff algorithm (`npm run start`).

You can try out the query plan visualizer at https://toemmsche.github.io/semantic-diff/.
